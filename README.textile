h2. Nginx Push Stream latency test tool

Nanosecond resolution tool for testing pub/sub latency in "nginxpushstream":https://github.com/wandenberg/nginx-push-stream-module module.

You should be running load/performance tests in parallel with another tool. From time to time, say 10 seconds, the latency.rb tool checks the amount of time Nginx Push Stream is taking to deliver one particular timestamped message. With that you can verify if your delivery time is according to your needs even under load.

I recommend testing with at least two distinct profiles:

- One separate channel only for latency (latency.rb tool running alone or at least it's test channel not sharing any traffic with other tool than the latency.rb itself). This way you can baseline the minimum latency achievable.

- One shared channel with many other subscribers and publishers (not only the latency.rb tool alone). This way you can stress the pipe and really check for the desired timely delivery you pursue in a more realistic way.
