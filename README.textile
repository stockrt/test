Get previous or next version number.

h1. Tests

This is just testing madness.

Try "roundup":http://bmizerany.github.com/roundup and see what a twisted mind
one can have by building insane and extensive testing:

    cd /tmp
    rm -rf bmizerany-roundup*
    curl -s -L https://github.com/bmizerany/roundup/tarball/master | tar xzvf -
    cd bmizerany-roundup*
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install
