== get_prev_next_version ==

Get previous or next version number.

== Tests ==

This is just testing madness.

Try [http://bmizerany.github.com/roundup roundup] and see what a twisted mind
one can have by building insane and extensive testing:

 <nowiki>Start with a space in the first column,
(before the <nowiki>).

Then your block format will be
    maintained.
 
This is good for copying in code blocks:

def function():
    """documentation string"""

    if True:
        print True
    else:
        print False</nowiki>

<pre>
cd /tmp
rm -rf bmizerany-roundup*
curl -s -L https://github.com/bmizerany/roundup/tarball/master | tar xzvf -
cd bmizerany-roundup*
./configure
make
sudo make install
</pre>
