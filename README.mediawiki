== get_prev_next_version ==

Get previous or next version number.

=== Tests ===

This is just testing madness.

Try [http://bmizerany.github.com/roundup roundup] and see what a twisted mind
one can have by building insane and extensive testing:

<code>
cd /tmp
rm -rf bmizerany-roundup*
curl -s -L https://github.com/bmizerany/roundup/tarball/master | tar xzvf -
cd bmizerany-roundup*
./configure
make
sudo make install
</code>
