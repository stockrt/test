h2. Nginx Push Stream latency test tool

Nanosecond resolution tool for testing pub/sub delay in "nginxpushstream":https://github.com/wandenberg/nginx-push-stream-module module.

You should be running load/performance test in parallel with another tool. From
time to time, say 10 seconds, the latency.rb tool checks the time Nginx Push
Stream is taking to deliver one particular timestamped message. With that you
can verify if your delivery time is according to your needs even under load.

I recommend testing one separate channel only for latency checks and also
testing one shared channel with many other subscribers and publishers, not only
the latency.rb tool, so you can stress the pipe and really check for the desired
timely delivery you pursue.
