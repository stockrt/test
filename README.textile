h2(#game). Invisible Battlefields Game

This game uses the "SDDL":http://lac-rio.com/software/contextnetsddl-scalable-data-distribution-layer software, part of the "ContextNet":http://lac-rio.com/projects/contextnet project from PUC-Rio.

h2(#running). Running the VM for server-side services

To install and run the servers for this game you will need an Ubuntu VM.
Doing this with Vagrant the installation can be pretty easy.
- First, install "Virtualbox":https://www.virtualbox.org and "Vagrant":http://www.vagrantup.com in your machine.
- Second, at the git clone directory, type:

<pre>
    vagrant up
</pre>

Ready, in a few minutes the VM should be running with all services installed.
- Vagrant allows you to easily destroy and recreate a VM.
When recreated, the VM will be totally reconfigured:

<pre>
    vagrant status
    vagrant destroy
    vagrant up
    vagrant reload
    vagrant provision
</pre>

* Note: This VM is designated to code execution, not to the development process. So, do not edit any files through the VM, use it only as a headless server (no GUI) to run the Gateway, Core Server and Web Server.
As a shared directory for files exchange between the host and the VM remember that the git clone directory is mapped to the VM /vagrant directory. The *git clone root directory* is the local directory (host) and the */vagrant* is the remote directory (VM).

- Accessing the VM:

<pre>
    vagrant ssh
</pre>

- Using the aliases to run the services:

<pre>
    gateway
    registry-server-dev
    registry-server
</pre>

- The Registry Web Console interface will be acessible at:

<pre>
    http://registry.vm
    or
    http://10.10.10.10
</pre>

h2(#exploring). Exploring the source code with Eclipse

To contribute with this project and edit/visualize the source code in Eclipse you will need to run a script with the "Play Framework":http://www.playframework.com that will prepare the git clone directory to be used in the Eclipse workspace.
- Inside the directory script, run eclipsify:

<pre>
    cd script
    ./eclipsify.sh
</pre>

- If you need to install Java:

<pre>
    sudo script/java-dl.sh
</pre>

The JAVA_HOME environment variable must be exported to Java version 7.
The PATH environment variable must give preference in load order to $JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH so that the *java* and *javac* commands are version 7:

<pre>
    export JAVA_HOME="/opt/java"
    export PATH="$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH"
</pre>

It is recommended that when importing the project to workspace you do not copy (do not check the copy option) so any updates from git can reflect immediately to your Eclipse environment.
